## Programmazione ad Oggetti (LT DIEF)

**Exam**

* Solve 2 exercises from the [learn-java-core](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-core) repository **(60% weight)**
* Answer general questions about the key topics of the course **(20% weight)**
* Discuss the structure and engineering choices of a home project **(20% weight)**

**Home Project**

* It has to provide value to other learners with insights on either natural phenomena (e.g., fractals-visualization) or the Java ecosystem (e.g., collections-benchmark).
* It has to contain a README.md explaining the project and its internals.
* 250-500 lines of logic code per person, excluding GUI/XML files.
* Use Maven as build tool.
* Refer to [learn-java-javafx](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-javafx/tree/main/code) for inspiration.

Can we develop the project in groups of 3 people?
> No, you can develop a project alone or with 1 colleague. Groups should be composed of teammates with comparable coding skills. Exceptions to this rule are negatively evaluated.

Can we use JavaScript, TypeScript, Kotlin, Dart, Swift, C++, C#?
> No! Only Java is allowed. 

Can we use external libraries?
> Sure! The object-oriented paradigm has been initially proposed for promoting the reuse of code and building larger projects!

What is the best moment for starting the project?
> The first half of the course concerns basic topics that must be assimilated before starting. My personal suggestion is to start the project around midterm and use the second part of the course to sketch out the main design.

While developing I get strange errors. What should I do?
> The first thing to do is copy and paste the error string on Google and check for eventual answers on StackOverflow. The vast majority of common errors has a dedicated page.

## Distributed Edge Programming (LM DIEF)

**Exam**

* Answer two questions, selected or adapted, from the Lab section of the course modules.
* Solve one exercise, selected or adapted from the Lab section of the course modules. Eventually, this portion of the exam, can be replaced with a home project. The project **must** be structured as a course module, including both a Markdown presentation and executable code, and be related to the course material (see modules_extra).
